# Rice Bootcamp Module 1: Refactoring Horiseon Page for Accessibility

## User Story

AS A marketing agency  <br>
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards  <br> 
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines   <br>

## Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards   <br>
WHEN I view the source code   <br>
THEN I find semantic HTML elements  <br>
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements  <br>
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning  <br>
WHEN I view the icon and image elements  <br>
THEN I find accessible alt attributes  <br>
WHEN I view the heading attributes  <br>
THEN they fall in sequential order  <br>
WHEN I view the title element  <br>
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title  <br>
